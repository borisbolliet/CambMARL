"We are at the beginning of a wave of real-world applications of artificial
intelligence, many of which will include reinforcement learning, deep and otherwise, that
will impact our lives in ways that are hard to predict." *Barto & Sutton (2018), see section on The Future of Artificial Intelligence*
